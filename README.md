# ebdp-lightweight

Lightweight modelling workflow for EBDP TWIN2EXPAND project for evidence based approaches to urban design and planning.

## Development

Project configuration is managed using a `pyproject.toml` file. For development purposes: `uv` is used for installation and management of the packages and related upgrades. For example: `uv sync` will install packages listed in the `pyproject.toml` file and creates a self-contained development environment in a `.venv` folder.
